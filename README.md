K-Means Clustering: Wine Data
This repo features clustering a *wine data set* (see https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine for the full data set description and download). 

This analysis looks at the 'Colour Intensity' and 'Flavinoids' variables in the data set and is a simple demonstration of how the K-Means method can be used to cluster data in real life. Each data point in the real data set is categorized into 3 separate clusters - '1', '2' or '3' - each corresponding to a different cultivar of grapes used in the wine-making process. 

We will first standardize the data, then divide the data points into 3 different clusters using the K-Means method. Finally, we will look at how this result compares visually to the way the data has been clustered in real life.
